# Western Navbar Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to complete the western-themed navbar implementation.

## Required Image Assets

To fully implement the western-themed navbar, you need to create or download the following assets and place them in the `/public/western/` directory:

1. **wooden-background.jpg** - A western wooden background texture for the navbar
2. **wooden-sign.png** - A western-style wooden sign/plaque image for buttons
3. **bullet-hole.png** - A bullet hole image with transparent background
4. **logo-background.png** - A wooden background for the logo area (optional)
5. **gunshot.mp3** - A gunshot sound effect audio file

## Enabling Image Assets

Once you have these files, you'll need to uncomment/modify the following:

1. In `src/components/western-navbar.css`:
   - Update the `.western-navbar` class to include `background: url('/western/wooden-background.jpg'), #3d2817;`
   - Update the `.western-button` class to include `background: url('/western/wooden-sign.png'), #8B4513;`
   - Update the `.bullet-hole` class to use the image `background-image: url('/western/bullet-hole.png');`

2. In `src/components/Navbar.tsx`:
   - In the `handleNavigation` function, uncomment the gunshot sound code and update the path to `/western/gunshot.mp3`

## Additional Customizations

You can further enhance the western theme:

- Add a logo in the logo area
- Adjust button rotations for a more handcrafted look
- Add more western-themed decorative elements
- Adjust text shadows and colors for better readability

## Troubleshooting

- If the gunshot sound doesn't play, make sure your browser allows autoplay of media
- If images don't load, check the paths and make sure they're correctly placed
- For any styling issues, inspect elements using browser developer tools

Enjoy your new western-themed navbar!
